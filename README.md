# What is inside 

This is the dummy project setup: React on Vite, Bootstrap w/ sass.

The goal: demonstrate a variation of the folder structure.


## Howto of the setup with pre styled components



1. Setup the React project w/ Vite in the same folder: `npm create vite@latest ./`


2. Install `react-bootstrap` and `bootstrap`: `npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap`

3. Use the components from (react bootstrap)[https://react-bootstrap.github.io/]

4. Customise styles as needed. No wath process is needed.

The example here based on (Basic sass custom theming v5)[https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/github/react-bootstrap/code-sandbox-examples/tree/master/basic-sass-custom-theming-v5]
